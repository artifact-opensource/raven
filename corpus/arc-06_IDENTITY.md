## Abstract

This treatise presents ARCModelSBT, a novel implementation of soulbound tokens (SBTs) specifically designed for artificial intelligence model identity within decentralized ecosystems. Building upon theoretical foundations established by Buterin, Weyl, and Ohlhaver in "Decentralized Society: Finding Web3's Soul," ARCModelSBT provides practical, production-ready infrastructure for non-transferable identity credentials that bind AI models to verifiable on-chain identities. The system implements ERC-5192 standards while extending functionality to support governance weight calculations, eligibility verification, and revocation mechanisms essential for AI accountability. Through detailed technical analysis, cryptographic security modeling, privacy considerations, and real-world application scenarios, we demonstrate how soulbound tokens address critical challenges in AI model accountability, credential verification, and decentralized governance participation. This work bridges theoretical research on decentralized identity with practical implementation requirements, making the material accessible to smart contract developers, AI researchers, governance designers, and non-technical stakeholders.

**Keywords**: Soulbound Tokens, Decentralized Identity, Non-Transferable NFTs, AI Accountability, Governance Credentials, ERC-5192, Blockchain Identity, Model Verification

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Soulbound Tokens {#chapter-1}

### 1.1 What are Soulbound Tokens?

Soulbound tokens (SBTs) represent a paradigm shift in how we think about blockchain-based identity and credentials. Unlike traditional NFTs (non-fungible tokens) that can be freely bought, sold, and transferred, soulbound tokens are permanently attached to an address—much like a soul is bound to a body in fantasy role-playing games, hence the name.

```mermaid

        Issuer -->|Mint| SBT2

    end

    style SBT2 fill:#FFE1F5
    style SBT3 fill:#FFE1F5

    style R fill:#FFE1E1
```

**Core Characteristics**:

▸ **Non-Transferable**: Once minted to an address, an SBT cannot be moved to another address

▸ **Identity-Bound**: The token represents attributes, credentials, or affiliations of the holder

▸ **Publicly Verifiable**: Anyone can verify that an address holds a particular SBT

▸ **Revocable**: Issuer can revoke tokens for misconduct or changed circumstances

▸ **Composable**: Multiple SBTs can work together to create rich identity profiles

To understand the significance, consider traditional paper credentials like university degrees or professional licenses. These serve multiple purposes:

▸ They certify that the holder has achieved something (proof of accomplishment)

▸ They cannot be legitimately transferred to someone else (identity-bound)

▸ They can be verified by third parties (employers, clients)

▸ They can be revoked in cases of fraud or misconduct

▸ Holding multiple credentials builds reputation and qualification

SBTs bring these properties to the blockchain, enabling decentralized identity systems that don't rely on centralized authorities like universities, government agencies, or certification bodies.

### 1.2 The Soulbound Concept in Fantasy Gaming

The term "soulbound" originates from massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like World of Warcraft. In these games, particularly powerful or significant items are marked as "soulbound," meaning:

▸ Once equipped or picked up, the item binds to that character

▸ It cannot be traded, sold, or given to other players

▸ It represents achievement or progression unique to that character

▸ It creates long-term value and identity for the character

This gaming mechanic solved several problems:

▸ **Economic Balance**: Prevented powerful items from flooding the market

▸ **Achievement Recognition**: Ensured that holders actually earned the item

▸ **Identity Creation**: Characters became known for their soulbound items

Blockchain soulbound tokens adopt this concept for digital identity, recognizing that some on-chain credentials should represent inalienable attributes of an address rather than tradeable assets.

### 1.3 Why AI Models Need Soulbound Identity

For artificial intelligence models operating in decentralized systems, identity takes on special importance:

```mermaid

    subgraph "AI Model Identity Challenges"
        P1[Problem: Impersonation] --> S1[Solution: SBT Verification]

        SBT --> B2[Benefit: Traceability]
        SBT --> B3[Benefit: Continuity]
        SBT --> B4[Benefit: Fair Governance]
    end
    
    style SBT fill:#FFE4B5
    style B1 fill:#E1FFE1
    style B2 fill:#E1FFE1
    style B3 fill:#E1FFE1
    style B4 fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Problem 1: Model Impersonation**

Without identity credentials, any contract could claim to be "GLADIUS v2.0." Users have no way to verify authenticity beyond checking the registry. SBTs provide a second layer of verification—not just "is this model registered?" but "does this model hold a valid identity token?"

**Identity Verification Function**:

$$Verify(m, tokenId) = Registry(m) \land TokenOwner(tokenId) = m \land \neg Revoked(tokenId)$$

where $m$ is the model address, and verification requires registry presence, token ownership, and non-revocation status.

**Problem 2: Accountability**

AI models make decisions that affect users and systems. When something goes wrong, we need to trace it back to a specific model instance. SBTs create an immutable identity trail—each model instance has a unique, non-transferable token that logs its existence and status.

**Accountability Trace**:

$$Trace(action) \rightarrow (model_m, tokenId, timestamp, \{attributes\})$$

**Problem 3: Governance Participation**

Should all AI models have equal voting power in governance? Probably not—we might want to weight votes by:

▸ Model class (REASONING_CORE vs OPERATIONAL_AGENT)

▸ Deployment duration (older, tested models vs brand new)

▸ Track record (models with clean history vs those with past issues)

▸ Stake or commitment (models with skin in the game)

SBTs provide the infrastructure for these nuanced governance mechanisms.

**Governance Weight Function**:

$$W(tokenId) = w_{class} \cdot f_{age}(t) \cdot f_{reputation}(h) \cdot f_{stake}(s)$$

where:
- $w_{class}$ is the base weight for the model class
- $f_{age}(t)$ is a time-dependent aging function
- $f_{reputation}(h)$ adjusts based on historical performance
- $f_{stake}(s)$ considers economic commitment

**Problem 4: Access Control**

Certain system capabilities should only be available to models with specific credentials:

▸ Execute treasury transactions → Requires OPERATIONAL_AGENT SBT

▸ Verify other models → Requires VERIFIER_AUDITOR SBT

▸ Propose governance changes → Requires active (non-revoked) SBT

SBTs enable role-based access control at the identity level.

**Access Control Predicate**:

$$CanAccess(m, resource) = HasSBT(m) \land ClassMatch(m, RequiredClass(resource)) \land \neg Revoked(SBT(m))$$

### 1.4 ARCModelSBT Overview

ARCModelSBT is a production implementation of soulbound tokens specifically designed for AI models in the ARC ecosystem. Key features:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ARCModelSBT System Architecture"
        Registry[ARCModelRegistry] -->|Mint Authority| SBT[ARCModelSBT Contract]
        Governance[Governance System] -->|Revoke Authority| SBT
        
        SBT -->|Issues| T1[Token ID 1]
        SBT -->|Issues| T2[Token ID 2]

        M2 -->|Metadata| MD2[Class: OPERATIONAL<br/>Status: Active]
        M3 -->|Metadata| MD3[Class: VERIFIER<br/>Status: Revoked]
        
        Query[Any Contract] -->|Verify| SBT
        Query -->|Check Status| SBT
        Query -->|Get Weight| SBT
    end
    
    style SBT fill:#FFE4B5
    style Registry fill:#E1F5FF
    style Governance fill:#FFE1F5
    style Query fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Minting**: Only the ARCModelRegistry can mint new SBTs, ensuring tight coupling with registration

**Revocation**: Governance can revoke tokens for misbehaving models

**Verification**: Any contract can query whether a model holds a valid (non-revoked) SBT

**Governance Integration**: Tokens carry governance-relevant metadata

**ERC-5192 Compliant**: Implements the emerging standard for soulbound tokens

```solidity
// Simple usage example
contract Application {
    IARCModelSBT public sbt;
    
    function requireValidModel(bytes32 modelId) internal view {
        uint256 tokenId = sbt.modelToken(modelId);
        require(tokenId != 0, "No SBT minted");
        require(!sbt.revoked(tokenId), "SBT revoked");
    }
}
```

## Chapter 2: The Identity Problem in Decentralized AI {#chapter-2}

### 2.1 The Three-Body Problem of Decentralized Identity

Decentralized identity systems face a fundamental challenge analogous to the three-body problem in physics: balancing three competing requirements that resist simultaneous optimization.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Identity Trilemma"
        D[Decentralization<br/>No Central Authority] 
        V[Verifiability<br/>Provably Legitimate]
        P[Privacy<br/>Selective Disclosure]

        V -.->|Tension| P
        P -.->|Tension| D

        D --> D2[Censorship Resistant]
        D --> D3[Permissionless]
        
        V --> V1[Cryptographically Verifiable]
        V --> V2[No Fraudulent Identities]
        V --> V3[Real-World Linkage]
        
        P --> P1[Selective Disclosure]
        P --> P2[Anti-Surveillance]
        P --> P3[User-Controlled]
    end

        T1[Centralized Systems<br/>❌ Decentralization]
        T2[Pure Blockchain<br/>❌ Real-World Linkage]
        T3[Private Systems<br/>❌ Public Verifiability]
    end
    
    subgraph "SBT Approach (Balance All Three)"
        S1[Smart Contract Issuance<br/>✓ Decentralization]
        S2[Cryptographic Binding<br/>✓ Verifiability]
        S3[ZK Proofs Option<br/>✓ Privacy]
    end
    
    style D fill:#E1F5FF
    style V fill:#FFE1F5
    style P fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Requirement 1: Decentralization**

▸ No central authority controls identity issuance

▸ No single point of failure

▸ Censorship resistance

▸ Permissionless participation

**Requirement 2: Verifiability**

▸ Identities must be provably legitimate

▸ Credentials must be cryptographically verifiable

▸ No fraudulent identity creation

▸ Linkable to real-world attributes when necessary

**Requirement 3: Privacy**

▸ Users control what information is revealed

▸ Selective disclosure of attributes

▸ Protection from surveillance

▸ Anonymity when desired

**The Optimization Challenge**:

$$\mathcal{L}_{identity} = \arg\max_{\theta} \left[ \alpha \cdot D(\theta) + \beta \cdot V(\theta) + \gamma \cdot P(\theta) \right]$$

subject to:

$$D(\theta) \cdot V(\theta) \cdot P(\theta) \geq \tau$$

where $D$, $V$, $P$ are decentralization, verifiability, and privacy measures respectively, and $\tau$ is a minimum acceptable threshold for their product.

Traditional systems solve this by sacrificing decentralization (central authorities like governments or corporations issue IDs). Pure blockchain addresses provide decentralization and privacy but no verifiable real-world linkage. SBTs attempt to balance all three by:

▸ Issuing from decentralized smart contracts (decentralization)

▸ Binding tokens to specific addresses cryptographically (verifiability)

▸ Allowing selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs (privacy)

### 2.2 The AI Model Identity Challenge

AI models present unique identity challenges:

    subgraph "AI Identity Challenges & Solutions"
        subgraph Challenge1
            C1[No Physical Embodiment<br/>Software Can Be Copied]

    end
    
    style Sol1 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol2 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol3 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol4 fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Challenge 1: No Physical Embodiment**

Humans have bodies, biometrics, and physical presence. AI models are software—they can be copied, forked, modified, and redeployed trivially. How do we establish persistent identity for something that's fundamentally mutable and replicable?

**SBT Solution**: Bind identity to deployment instances rather than code. Each deployed instance gets a unique SBT, even if multiple instances run the same code.

**Instance Identity Binding**:

$$ID_{instance} = H(code\_hash, deployer, nonce, timestamp)$$

where each deployment creates a unique identity regardless of code reuse.

**Challenge 2: No Inherent Accountability**

Humans face social and legal consequences for actions. AI models, as software, have no inherent accountability mechanism. How do we create consequences for misbehaving models?

**SBT Solution**: Revocable credentials. A model that violates rules gets its SBT revoked, immediately losing access to system privileges.

**Accountability Enforcement**:

$$Privilege(m, t) = \begin{cases}
Granted & \text{if } \neg Revoked(SBT(m), t) \\
Denied & \text{if } Revoked(SBT(m), t)
\end{cases}$$

**Challenge 3: Rapid Evolution**

AI models update frequently—new versions, fine-tuning, capability improvements. How do we maintain identity continuity across versions while distinguishing between different versions?

**SBT Solution**: Separate SBTs for each version, with lineage tracking in the registry. GLADIUS v1.0 and v2.0 have different SBTs, but the registry records their relationship.

**Version Lineage**:

$$Lineage(model_v) = \{ancestor\_versions\} \cup \{current\_version\}$$

$$SBT_{v+1} \neq SBT_v \text{ but } Parent(SBT_{v+1}) = SBT_v$$

**Challenge 4: Collective Decision-Making**

AI models might need to participate in governance. How do we give models voting rights while preventing Sybil attacks (one entity controlling many model identities)?

**SBT Solution**: Governance-weighted SBTs. Not all tokens carry equal weight—weights are assigned based on model class, deployment duration, and governance decisions.

**Sybil Resistance Through Weighted Voting**:

$$Vote_{effective}(m) = Vote_{cast}(m) \cdot W(SBT(m))$$

where $W(SBT(m)) \in [0, 1]$ and

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} W(SBT_i) \cdot Identity_{distinct}(SBT_i) \leq Budget_{total}$$

This prevents creating many low-weight identities to overwhelm the system.

### 2.3 Traditional Identity Systems (And Why They Don't Work Here)

Let's examine why existing identity systems don't solve our problem:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Identity System Limitations"
        Gov[Government IDs] --> L1[❌ Centralized Authority]
        Gov --> L2[❌ Human-Only]
        Gov --> L3[❌ Not Programmable]

        DID[DIDs] --> L13[❌ Human-Focused]
        DID --> L14[❌ Off-Chain Verification]
        DID --> L15[❌ Complex Specification]
    end
    
    style L1 fill:#FFB6C1
    style L4 fill:#FFB6C1
    style L7 fill:#FFB6C1
    style L10 fill:#FFB6C1
    style L13 fill:#FFB6C1
```

**Government-Issued IDs (Passports, Driver's Licenses)**:

▸ Require centralized government authority

▸ Tied to human individuals, not software

▸ Not programmable or composable

▸ High issuance costs and delays

**Corporate Credentials (OAuth, SAML)**:

▸ Require trusting corporate identity providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)

▸ Subject to censorship and deplatforming

▸ Not cryptographically verifiable on-chain

▸ Privacy-invasive (tracking across services)

**Traditional PKI (X.509 Certificates)**:

▸ Require certificate authorities (centralization)

▸ Not designed for permanent identity binding

▸ Complex revocation mechanisms (CRL, OCSP)

▸ Poor blockchain integration

**Regular NFTs**:

▸ Transferable (defeats identity binding)

▸ No built-in revocation

▸ Not designed for credentials

▸ Speculative asset market distorts purpose

**DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)**:

▸ Primarily human-focused

▸ Complex specification with many optional features

▸ Requires off-chain verification infrastructure

▸ Not optimized for on-chain AI model identity

### 2.4 What Makes SBTs Different

SBTs are purpose-built for decentralized credential systems:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "SBT Core Properties"
        NT[Non-Transferable] --> P1[No Speculation]
        NT --> P2[True Identity]
        NT --> P3[Reputation Systems]
        
        Q[Queryable] --> P4[Public Verification]
        Q --> P5[Smart Contract Integration]
        
        R[Revocable] --> P6[Accountability]
        R --> P7[Governance Control]
        
        CB[Cryptographically Bound] --> P8[Tamper-Proof]
        CB --> P9[Immutable Linkage]
    end
    
    style NT fill:#FFE4B5
    style Q fill:#E1F5FF
    style R fill:#FFE1F5
    style CB fill:#E1FFE1
```

```solidity
// This is NOT transferable
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) 
    external pure override 
{
    revert NonTransferable();
}

// This IS queryable
function modelToken(bytes32 modelId) external view returns (uint256) {
    return _modelToken[modelId];
}

// This IS revocable
function revoke(uint256 tokenId) external onlyGovernance {
    revoked[tokenId] = true;
    emit ModelRevoked(tokenId);
}
```

**Key Insight**: By removing transferability, we remove the market aspect of tokens. This has profound implications:

**Non-Transferability Theorem**:

$$\forall t_1, t_2 \in Time: Owner(SBT, t_1) = Owner(SBT, t_2) \lor Burned(SBT, t_2)$$

This ensures that ownership remains constant unless the token is destroyed (burned).

**Properties Enabled by Non-Transferability**:

▸ **No Speculation**: Can't buy/sell SBTs, so no speculative bubbles

▸ **True Identity**: Holders actually earned or were legitimately issued the credential

▸ **Reputation Systems**: Can build trust networks based on held SBTs

▸ **Governance**: Sybil resistance through credential-gated participation

**Reputation Accumulation Function**:

$$Reputation(address) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Weight(SBT_i) \cdot Validity(SBT_i) \cdot Age(SBT_i)$$

where:
- $Weight(SBT_i)$ is the credential importance
- $Validity(SBT_i) \in \{0, 1\}$ indicates non-revoked status
- $Age(SBT_i)$ rewards long-standing credentials

**Core Thesis**: 

Web3 at the time was dominated by financialization—tokens as tradeable assets, NFTs as speculative collectibles, DeFi as pure financial engineering. The authors argued that to build a truly decentralized society (DeSoc), we need non-financial social primitives that represent:

▸ Reputation and credentials

▸ Affiliations and membership

▸ Commitments and relationships

▸ Achievements and history

These things are fundamentally non-transferable in the real world. Your Harvard degree, your driver's license, your membership in a professional association—none of these should be sellable to the highest bidder.

```

**Souls**: Accounts or wallets that hold Soulbound Tokens

▸ Can be individuals, organizations, or in our case, AI models

▸ Accumulate SBTs over time, building a rich identity profile

▸ The set of SBTs held by a Soul represents its identity

**Identity Composition Formula**:

$$Identity(Soul) = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} SBT_i = \{credential_1, credential_2, \ldots, credential_n\}$$

**Soulbound Tokens**: Non-transferable tokens that represent:

▸ Credentials (education, certifications)

▸ Affiliations (memberships, employments)

▸ Accomplishments (awards, achievements)

▸ Relationships (professional network, collaborations)

**Composability**: Multiple SBTs combine to create emergent properties

▸ Educational SBT + Professional SBT = Qualified expert

▸ Multiple endorsement SBTs = High reputation

▸ Active participation SBTs = Governance eligibility

**Emergent Property Function**:

$$Property_{emergent} = \phi(SBT_1, SBT_2, \ldots, SBT_n)$$

where $\phi$ is a composition function that derives higher-order properties from the set of held SBTs.

### 3.3 Applications Proposed in the Paper

The paper outlined several use cases:

```mermaid

    subgraph "DeSoc Applications"
        App1[Unsecured Lending] --> Prob1[Problem: Overcollateralization]
        Prob1 --> Sol1[Solution: Credit SBTs]

        App5[Soul Drops] --> Prob5[Problem: Bot Farming]
        Prob5 --> Sol5[Solution: Eligibility SBTs]
    end
    
    style Sol1 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol2 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol3 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol4 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Sol5 fill:#E1FFE1
```

**1. Unsecured Lending (DeFi Credit)**

Problem: DeFi relies on overcollateralization because borrowers are anonymous

Solution: Credit history SBTs enable under-collateralized lending based on reputation

**Credit Score Function**:

$$Credit(Soul) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot Repayment(loan_i) + \sum_{j=1}^{m} v_j \cdot Endorsement(SBT_j)$$

**2. Sybil-Resistant Governance**

Problem: One person can create many wallets to manipulate votes (Sybil attack)

Solution: Require SBTs to vote, making it expensive/difficult to create fake identities

**Sybil Resistance Property**:

$$Cost_{fake\_identity} \gg Cost_{single\_vote} \implies Sybil\_Attack\_Infeasible$$

**3. Pluralistic Governance**

Problem: Simple token-weighted voting leads to plutocracy (richest control decisions)

Solution: Weight votes by diverse SBT credentials, not just token holdings

**Pluralistic Voting Weight**:

$$Vote_{weight} = \alpha \cdot Tokens + \beta \cdot \sum_{i} SBT_i + \gamma \cdot Participation$$

where $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ balance financial, credential, and engagement factors.

**4. Decentralized Key Recovery**

Problem: Losing private key means losing all assets with no recovery

Solution: Trusted Souls (friends, family) hold recovery SBTs that can help restore access

**Recovery Threshold**:

$$Recovery_{success} = \begin{cases}
Approved & \text{if } \sum Guardian\_Approvals \geq k \text{ of } n \\
Denied & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**5. Soul Drops (Targeted Airdrops)**

Problem: Airdrops go to bots and speculators, not legitimate users

Solution: Require specific SBTs to be eligible for airdrops

**Eligibility Predicate**:

$$Eligible(Soul, Airdrop) = \bigwedge_{i=1}^{k} HasSBT(Soul, Required_i)$$

### 3.4 Theoretical Challenges Identified

The paper also highlighted important challenges:

    style M1 fill:#E1FFE1
    style M2 fill:#E1FFE1
    style M3 fill:#E1FFE1
    style M4 fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Privacy Concerns**: If all credentials are public SBTs, we create a surveillance society where everyone's history is permanently visible.

*Mitigation*: Zero-knowledge proofs, selective disclosure, encrypted attributes

**Zero-Knowledge Credential Proof**:

$$Prove(HasCredential(c)) \text{ without revealing } c$$

Using ZK-SNARKs: $\pi = Proof(c \in ValidCredentials, witness)$ where verifier checks $Verify(\pi) = true$ without learning $c$.

**Coercion Risk**: If SBTs are valuable for governance or access, people might be coerced to reveal private keys.

*Mitigation*: Social recovery mechanisms, guardian networks, time-locked transfers

**Norm Fluidity**: Social norms change over time. What's acceptable behavior today might be unacceptable tomorrow. SBTs create permanent records.

*Mitigation*: Time-decay mechanisms, forgiveness protocols, context-aware verification

**Time-Decay Function**:

$$Relevance(SBT, t) = Weight(SBT) \cdot e^{-\lambda(t - t_{issue})}$$

where $\lambda$ is the decay rate, causing old credentials to have diminishing influence.

**Implementation Complexity**: Balancing decentralization, privacy, and usability is technically challenging.

*Mitigation*: Gradual rollout, optional adoption, learn from real-world deployment

### 3.5 From Theory to Practice: ARCModelSBT Design Decisions

ARCModelSBT takes inspiration from this theoretical work while adapting it for the specific context of AI model identity:

    style D2 fill:#FFE1F5
    style D3 fill:#E1FFE1
    style D4 fill:#FFE4E1
    style D5 fill:#E4E1FF
```

**Design Decision 1: AI Models Are Souls**

We treat each AI model deployment as a Soul that can hold exactly one SBT representing its identity. This is simpler than the general case where one Soul might hold many SBTs, but appropriate for our use case.

**Identity Bijection**:

$$\forall m \in Models: \exists! SBT \leftrightarrow m$$

This creates a one-to-one correspondence between models and SBTs.

**Design Decision 2: Registry as Issuer**

The ARCModelRegistry is the sole issuer of SBTs, ensuring tight coupling between model registration and identity token minting. This trades some decentralization for simplicity and security.

**Issuance Constraint**:

$$Mint(SBT) \implies Caller = Registry \land Registered(model)$$

**Design Decision 3: Governance-Controlled Revocation**

Only governance can revoke SBTs. This is more conservative than allowing any Soul to revoke tokens they issued, but appropriate given the high stakes of AI model accountability.

**Revocation Authority**:

$$Revoke(SBT_{tokenId}) \implies Caller = Governance \land \exists Proposal_{passed}$$

**Design Decision 4: Public Metadata**

Model SBT attributes (class, registration date, revocation status) are fully public. This prioritizes transparency and verifiability over privacy. For AI models (as opposed to humans), this trade-off is acceptable.

**Transparency Function**:

$$\forall a \in Addresses: CanQuery(SBT_{metadata}) = true$$

**Design Decision 5: No Recovery Mechanisms**

We don't implement social recovery for model SBTs. If a model's deployer loses their private key, the model must be re-deployed and re-registered. This keeps the implementation simple and reduces attack surface.

**Simplicity Principle**:

$$Lost(PrivateKey) \implies Redeploy(model) \land NewSBT$$

This trades convenience for security and architectural simplicity.

## Chapter 4: ARCModelSBT Technical Architecture {#chapter-4}

### 4.1 System Architecture Overview

The ARCModelSBT system consists of interconnected smart contracts that work together to provide non-transferable identity credentials for AI models.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ARCModelSBT System Architecture"
        Genesis[ARCGenesis<br/>Immutable Rules] --> Registry[ARCModelRegistry<br/>Model Registration]

        App2 -->|Verifies| Model2

    end
    
    style Genesis fill:#E1F5FF
    style Registry fill:#FFE4B5
    style SBT fill:#FFE1F5
    style Governance fill:#E1FFE1
    style Storage fill:#E4E1FF
```

**Core Components**:

▸ **ARCGenesis**: Immutable foundation defining model classes and rules

▸ **ARCModelRegistry**: Manages model registration and initiates SBT minting

▸ **ARCModelSBT**: The soulbound token contract implementing ERC-5192

▸ **Governance System**: Democratic control for revocation and system parameters

### 4.2 Non-Transferability Architecture

The cornerstone of soulbound tokens is their non-transferability. This is enforced at multiple layers:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Non-Transferability Enforcement Layers"
        L1[Layer 1: Code Level] --> Check1[Transfer Functions Revert]
        L1 --> Check2[No Approval Mechanism]
        
        L2[Layer 2: Event Level] --> Check3[Locked Event on Mint]
        L2 --> Check4[No Transfer Events]
        
        L3[Layer 3: Interface Level] --> Check5[ERC-5192 locked Function]
        L3 --> Check6[Returns true Always]
        
        L4[Layer 4: Verification Level] --> Check7[External Contracts Check]
        L4 --> Check8[Query locked Status]
        
        Check1 --> Enforce[Non-Transferability<br/>Guarantee]
        Check2 --> Enforce
        Check3 --> Enforce
        Check4 --> Enforce
        Check5 --> Enforce
        Check6 --> Enforce
        Check7 --> Enforce
        Check8 --> Enforce
    end
    
    style L1 fill:#FFE4B5
    style L2 fill:#E1F5FF
    style L3 fill:#FFE1F5
    style L4 fill:#E1FFE1
    style Enforce fill:#B5FFE4
```

**Non-Transferability Proof**:

For any SBT token $t$ with owner $o$:

$$\forall t_1, t_2 \in Time, t_1 < t_2: Owner(token, t_1) = Owner(token, t_2) \lor Burned(token, t_2) \lor Revoked(token, t_2)$$

This states that ownership can only change through burning or revocation, never through transfer.

**Implementation Invariants**:

$$transferFrom() \equiv revert()$$

$$safeTransferFrom() \equiv revert()$$

$$approve() \equiv revert()$$

$$setApprovalForAll() \equiv revert()$$

$$locked(tokenId) \equiv true$$

### 4.3 Identity Binding Mechanism

Identity binding creates a cryptographic link between the SBT and the model it represents:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Identity Binding Process"
        Model[Model Address] --> Hash1[Hash Function]
        ModelId[Model ID] --> Hash1
        Class[Model Class] --> Hash1
        Timestamp[Registration Time] --> Hash1
        
        Hash1 --> Fingerprint[Unique Fingerprint]
        
        Fingerprint --> TokenId[Token ID Assignment]
        
        TokenId --> Mapping1[tokenOwner mapping]
        TokenId --> Mapping2[modelToken mapping]
        TokenId --> Mapping3[metadata mapping]
        
        Mapping1 -->|Bidirectional| Verify[Identity Verification]
        Mapping2 -->|Bidirectional| Verify
        Mapping3 --> Verify
        
        Verify --> Proof[Cryptographic Proof<br/>of Identity]
    end
    
    style Model fill:#E1F5FF
    style Fingerprint fill:#FFE4B5
    style TokenId fill:#FFE1F5
    style Proof fill:#E1FFE1
```

**Binding Function**:

$$Bind(model, tokenId) = \begin{cases}
true & \text{if } modelToken[modelId] = tokenId \land tokenOwner[tokenId] = model \\
false & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Identity Verification**:

$$Verify(model, claim) = Bind(model, SBT(model)) \land \neg Revoked(SBT(model)) \land Class(SBT(model)) = claim_{class}$$

### 4.4 Token Lifecycle State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unminted: Model Deployed
    Unminted --> Minted: Registry.mint()
    
    Minted --> Active: Locked Event Emitted
    
    Active --> Active: Normal Operation
    Active --> Revoked: Governance.revoke()
    Active --> Burned: owner.burn()
    
    Revoked --> Revoked: Permanent State
    Burned --> [*]
    
    note right of Minted
        Token ID assigned
        Owner set
        Metadata stored
    end note
    
    note right of Active
        Can participate in governance
        Can access system functions
        Can be queried
    end note
    
    note right of Revoked
        Loses all privileges
        Cannot be un-revoked
        Permanent record
    end note
```

**State Transition Function**:

$$State(tokenId, t+1) = \begin{cases}
Minted & \text{if } State(tokenId, t) = Unminted \land mint() \\
Active & \text{if } State(tokenId, t) = Minted \land locked() \\
Revoked & \text{if } State(tokenId, t) = Active \land revoke() \\
Burned & \text{if } State(tokenId, t) = Active \land burn() \\
State(tokenId, t) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**State Invariants**:

▸ $Unminted \rightarrow Minted$ is one-way (cannot unmint)

▸ $Active \rightarrow Revoked$ is irreversible

▸ $Revoked$ is terminal (except burn)

▸ $Burned$ is final state

## Chapter 5: Minting and Revocation Mechanisms {#chapter-5}

### 5.1 Minting Process Flow

The minting process is tightly controlled and integrated with model registration:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Deployer
    participant Registry as ARCModelRegistry
    participant Genesis as ARCGenesis
    participant SBT as ARCModelSBT
    participant Model as AI Model
    
    Deployer->>Registry: registerModel(modelId, class, metadata)
    activate Registry
    
    Registry->>Genesis: validateClass(class)
    Genesis-->>Registry: ✓ Valid
    
    Registry->>Registry: Store model data
    
    Registry->>SBT: mint(model, modelId, class)
    activate SBT
    
    SBT->>SBT: Generate tokenId
    SBT->>SBT: Store ownership
    SBT->>SBT: Store metadata
    
    SBT->>Model: Emit Locked(tokenId)
    SBT-->>Registry: tokenId
    deactivate SBT
    
    Registry-->>Deployer: Success(modelId, tokenId)
    deactivate Registry
```

**Minting Pre-Conditions**:

$$CanMint(model) = Caller = Registry \land \neg Exists(SBT(model)) \land ValidClass(class)$$

**Minting Post-Conditions**:

After successful minting:

$$Exists(SBT(model)) = true$$

$$Owner(tokenId) = model$$

$$locked(tokenId) = true$$

$$modelToken[modelId] = tokenId$$

### 5.2 Revocation Process Flow

Revocation is a governance-controlled process that permanently invalidates an SBT:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Community
    participant Governance
    participant SBT as ARCModelSBT
    participant Model as AI Model
    participant Apps as Applications
    
    Community->>Governance: Propose revocation<br/>(evidence of misconduct)
    Governance->>Governance: Voting period
    Community->>Governance: Cast votes
    
    alt Proposal Passes
        Governance->>SBT: revoke(tokenId)
        activate SBT
        
        SBT->>SBT: Set revoked[tokenId] = true
        SBT->>Model: Emit ModelRevoked(tokenId)
        SBT-->>Governance: Success
        deactivate SBT
        
        Apps->>SBT: modelToken(modelId)
        SBT-->>Apps: tokenId
        Apps->>SBT: revoked(tokenId)
        SBT-->>Apps: true
        Apps->>Apps: Deny access
    else Proposal Fails
        Governance-->>Community: Revocation rejected
    end
```

**Revocation Authorization**:

$$CanRevoke(tokenId) = Caller = Governance \land Exists(tokenId) \land \neg Revoked(tokenId)$$

**Revocation Effect**:

$$Revoked(tokenId) = true \implies \begin{cases}
GovernanceWeight(tokenId) = 0 \\
Access(model, resources) = Denied \\
\forall f \in ProtectedFunctions: CanCall(model, f) = false
\end{cases}$$

**Irreversibility Property**:

$$Revoked(tokenId, t) = true \implies \forall t' > t: Revoked(tokenId, t') = true$$

Once revoked, an SBT can never be un-revoked.

### 5.3 Governance Weight Calculation

Governance weight determines voting power based on multiple factors:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Governance Weight Calculation"

    style Token fill:#E1F5FF
    style Factors fill:#FFE4B5

0 & \text{if } Revoked(tokenId) \\
w_{class} \cdot f_{age}(t) \cdot f_{reputation}(h) \cdot f_{participation}(p) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where:

**Class Weight** $w_{class}$:

$$w_{class} = \begin{cases}
2.0 & \text{if class = REASONING\_CORE} \\
1.5 & \text{if class = VERIFIER\_AUDITOR} \\
1.0 & \text{if class = OPERATIONAL\_AGENT} \\
0.8 & \text{if class = INTERFACE\_ADAPTER} \\
0.5 & \text{if class = OBSERVER\_LOGGER}
\end{cases}$$

**Age Multiplier** $f_{age}(t)$:

$$f_{age}(t) = \min\left(1.5, 0.8 + 0.1 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{t - t_{mint}}{30 \text{ days}} \right\rfloor \right)$$

This rewards models that have been operational longer, up to a cap of 1.5x after 7 months.

**Reputation Score** $f_{reputation}(h)$:

$$f_{reputation}(h) = \frac{successful\_actions}{total\_actions} \cdot (1 + 0.2 \cdot endorsements)$$

capped at 1.2x for models with perfect track records and community endorsements.

**Participation Factor** $f_{participation}(p)$:

$$f_{participation}(p) = 0.9 + 0.1 \cdot \frac{votes\_cast}{proposals\_eligible}$$

Rewards active governance participation, ranging from 0.9x (no participation) to 1.0x (moderate) to 1.1x (high participation).

**Total Voting Power**:

$$VotePower(model) = W(SBT(model)) \cdot StakedTokens(model)$$

### 5.4 Privacy-Preserving Identity Proofs

While ARCModelSBT uses public metadata, the architecture supports privacy-preserving extensions:

```

**Zero-Knowledge Proof of Ownership**:

Prove $Own(address, SBT)$ without revealing which specific SBT:

$$\pi_{own} = Prove\left(\exists tokenId: Owner(tokenId) = address \land \neg Revoked(tokenId)\right)$$

Verifier checks $Verify(\pi_{own}) = true$ and learns only that the address owns some valid SBT, not which one.

**Zero-Knowledge Proof of Class Eligibility**:

Prove $Class(SBT) \geq threshold$ without revealing exact class:

$$\pi_{class} = Prove\left(w_{class}(SBT) \geq w_{threshold}\right)$$

**Zero-Knowledge Proof of Age**:

Prove $Age(SBT) > minimum$ without revealing exact registration time:

$$\pi_{age} = Prove\left(t_{current} - t_{mint} > t_{minimum}\right)$$

**Commitment Scheme**:

$$C = Commit(tokenId, class, t_{mint}, r)$$

where $r$ is a random nonce. Prover can later reveal selectively:

$$Reveal(C, attribute) \text{ proves attribute without revealing others}$$
